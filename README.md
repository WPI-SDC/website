### Guidelines
As a general rule, please use common sense when making contributions. All code should be easily understandable (i.e. don't use JSFUCK). This includes, but is not limited to the following:
* Filenames should not have spaces in them (specifically images) - this makes it easier to use them
* Filenames should be descriptive (specifically images where possible)
* Images should be optimized (as small as possible)
* All CSS and Javascript should be put it separate files from the HTML, unless absolutely necessary
* Adhere to SDC style guidelines (available somewhere on Google Drive)
* Where appropriate, adhere to WPI style guidelines
* Test your changes on a separate branch before submitting a pull request to main. 
  * Note: Github pages does not directly support viewing branches other than main, but branches can be accessed using: `rawgit.com/wpi-sdc/wpi-sdc.github.io/BRANCH_NAME/index.html`

Please suggest more guidelines, these were all I could think of right now.
