                    <p>The SDC is a group of talented young engineers with diverse backgrounds and interests.
                        We are currently conducting research for and designing a CubeSat for Low Earth Orbit (LEO)
                        operations. When
                        launched, this satellite will be the first to represent WPI in space. We intend to apply to
                        NASA's CubeSat Launch Initiative, which will allow us to share a ride into space with a NASA
                        primary payload.</p>

                        The SDC typically has two team meetings per week: a one-hour General Body Meeting (GBM)
                        focused on administrative tasks and planning, and a work meeting on the weekend to focus
                        on completing tasks and collaborating with other subgroups.</p>

                    <p>The Satellite Development Club (SDC) at WPI is a student-run organization that facilitates
                        development of students’ technical and professional skills through the investigation of
                        space technologies. The SDC began as a spin-off from a WPI Major Qualifying Project in 2013
                        and has evolved into the team it is today, with team members from many majors. From 2014
                        to 2016, the SDC competed in NASA's Cube Quest Challenge - a competition to send a CubeSat
                        into deep space. In October 2016, the club transitioned to applying to NASA's CubeSat
                        Launch Initiative (CSLI) to conduct scientific experiments in Low Earth Orbit.</p>
                    <p>In addition CubeSats, one of the main goals of the SDC it to give students the opportunity
                        to network with companies and practice collaborative problem solving
                        within an interdisciplinary team. Students gain experience communicating via technical
                        writing, design reviews, public speaking, and a dynamic work environment. The SDC also provides
                        students with the resources to gain knowledge in technical fields related to space and
                        encourages them to expand their horizons.

                    <p>CubeSats are a standard, inexpensive way to explore outer space in low Earth orbit and beyond.
                        They consist of one or more 10cm cube sections that hold basic systems and a specialized
                        payload. The most basic CubeSat, designated "1U", is a 10cm cube, and some of the largest are
                        10cm by 20cm by
                        30cm, or “6U” CubeSats. Their small size and standardized deployment system make CubeSats
                        popular for universities and other organizations to educate students and try out new space
                        technologies relatively inexpensively and quickly. California Polytechnic State University and
                        Stanford University first proposed standardized design specifications for CubeSats in 1999 and
                        launched the first CubeSats in June, 2003. Since 2003, over 500 CubeSats have been launched by
                        universities, and many others have been launched by other organizations. CubeSats are continuing
                        to grow in popularity in the space industry, and it is time for WPI with its rich history of
                        spaceflight to join the program.

                    <p>NASA’s CubeSat Launch Initiative allows various
                        organizations including university groups to
                        propose CubeSats ranging from 1U to 6U for
                        launch alongside a NASA primary mission.
                        There are several requirement for applicants,
                        including the completion of two external
                        reviews. Additionally, the funding for the
                        CubeSat itself must be secured prior to
                        submission - NASA only provides the launch.
                    </p>

                    <p>For our CSLI, the SDC is designing and building the Goddard Orbital Atmospheric and Testing
                        Satellite (GOATS) which will carry a payload to
                        measure radiation levels in Low Earth Orbit
                        (LEO). The core component of the payload is a
                        scintillator, which is a specific material that emits
                        photons when struck by radiation. The purpose
                        of this payload is to better characterize radiation
                        levels in LEO, specifically in orbits near the
                        International Space Station and its inhabitants.
                        The more that is known about radiation levels in
                        a given orbit, the safer and more reliable it is for
                        missions, manned and unmanned, to operate
                        there.
                    </p>
                    <p>Beyond the scientific goal we aim to achieve, our secondary goal is to supplement
                        the education of engineers of the future. By working in an
                        interdisciplinary team, students will gain
                        invaluable experience prior to entering the
                        workforce. Furthermore, opportunities to work
                        with external partners such as NASA and other
                        stakeholders will allow students to develop their
                        professional skills while working on a large
                        project. This benefits both our students and our
                        future employers, as we will be better equipped
                        to help tackle the problems of the future.</p>

                        side projects throughout the year. These projects, all of which are related to aerospace,
                        are geared towards letting our members explore new ideas and hone their skills. Often, but
                        not always, side projects have components that support development of the CubeSat. Examples
                        of current projects are:
                    </p>
                    <ul>

                        competing in NASA's Cube Quest Challenge to design a CubeSat for deep space operations.
                        We worked on the Cube Quest Challenge until the fall of 2016 when we transitioned to CSLI,
                        which we are currently working on. Participating in Cube Quest gave us a better understanding
                        of what is required of a CubeSat design, helped us improve our public speaking skills and
                        overall set us up to succeed in our current project.</p>
                    <p>Other past projects have included designing, building, and launching a model rocket and building
